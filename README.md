# Tic Tac Toe

> In this project, I created a simple but amazing Tic Tac Toe game.

Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares; noughts and crosses.

## How it works

- The game starts by requiring the two players to enter their names, one after the other
- The game does a bid to randomly select player to start
- The player that wins the bid starts by entering a number between 1 and 9
- Numbers already chosen are taken off the list of available options so players can not choice them again
- Available options are displayed to players as they play
- The first person to put 3 letters next to each other horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins
- If all nine spaces are filled without anyone winning, the game reports a tie
